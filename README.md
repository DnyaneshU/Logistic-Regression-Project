# Logistic-Regression-Project
This project aims to predict whether a vehicle is likely to break down or require maintenance using Logistic Regression,  a supervised machine learning algorithm. By analyzing key features like mileage, engine temperature, and service history, the model classifies vehicles into 2 classes: 1( needs Maintenance) or 0( no Maintenance needed).
